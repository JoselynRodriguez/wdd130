        <p>Hello! My name is Joselyn Rodriguez, and I am from Lima, Peru. I'm 25 years old.
            I'm studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho.
            I enjoy reading, listening to music, dancing, and learning new languages. I also love pets and especially
            cats.
            I have a female cat named Tata and a female dog named Layca. I'm currently studying Chinese. This is a
            beautiful language,
            but it is very difficult. It requires a lot of practice and consistency, as in Software Development.
            I love technology and computers because they open new opportunities for us.</p>
